		<h2 align="center" style="color:white">Introduction</h2>
		<p align="justify" style="color:#48E9F1; text-indent:30px"> Welcome to my life's pages. My life has been one of development, learning, and pursuing my aspirations. 
		I was born on a beautiful and wonderful country, Philippines on August 2, 2002 at Christ the King Hospital located at Las Pinas City.  
		My life has been weaved together like a tapestry using the strands of my family, my education, and my unyielding resolve.</p>

		<h2 align="center" style="color:white">Early Days in Bacoor</h2>
		<p align="justify" style="color:#48E9F1; text-indent:30px">I took my first steps and said my first words at Bacoor, Cavite, where my adventure began. 
		My devoted parents, Gina and Jerry, also cherished my older brother, John Micko, and myself. 
		My support system has always been my family, who have always loved and supported me. 
		My family gave me the love, support, and direction that have been the foundation of my path, just like the strongest and most robust fibers. 
		Their unfailing confidence in me has been a continual source of inspiration for me, inspiring me to aim high and constantly pursue perfection.</p>

		<h2 align="center" style="color:white">The Joys of Childhood</h2>
		<p align="justify" style="color:#48E9F1; text-indent:30px">Christian Jo Ann School was where I received my early education, and it was there that I also finished elementary school in 2015. 
		It was owned by my grandmother. Since I was a baby, my father always brought me to our school since my mother is a teacher at a public school in Bacoor. 
		My cousins and I grew up in that school. 
		And from there, Aside studying, I was able to hone my talent in playing different sports like volleyball, basketball, and badminton. 
		These years laid the groundwork for my future academic endeavors as well as many new connections and fascinating discoveries.</p>

		<h2 align="center" style="color:white">Navigating Adolescence</h2>
		<p align="justify" style="color:#48E9F1; text-indent:30px">I confronted the difficulties and rewards of adolescence as I entered junior high school, also at Christian Jo Ann School. 
		I also improved myself in different sports that I became a captain ball and have been won the championship for both volleyball and badminton during our school intramurals. 
		I met people that helped me improve on the things I need to improve. 
		I strengthened my devotion to study and personal development over this time, and I finished junior high school in 2019.</p>
		<hr>
		
		<h2 align="center" style="color:white">The Road to Senior High</h2>
		<p align="justify" style="color:#48E9F1; text-indent:30px">I started a new chapter for senior high school in the Josiah Christian Values High School and Southern Philippines Institute of Science and Technology, 
		where I kept pursuing my academic passions. 
		Many things happened but I still kept fighting for my future. These years' experiences and lessons served as the foundation for my path into higher education.</p>
		<hr>
		
		<h2 align="center" style="color:white">Pursuing Higher Education</h2>
		<p align="justify" style="color:#48E9F1; text-indent:30px">At Adamson University, where I am currently a student of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering, 
		I am pursuing my goals and desires. I am looking forward to the chances for intellectual and personal improvement that lay ahead as a college student. 
		My life's tale would not be complete without the vivid and varied strands that make up my tapestry of education. It has not only given me information, 
		but it has also encouraged my curiosity and strengthened my interests. I have learned about the immense views of opportunity that lie ahead via my pursuit of knowledge.</p>
		<hr>
		
		<h2 align="center" style="color:white">Dreams and Aspirations</h2>
		<p align="justify" style="color:#48E9F1; text-indent:30px">I want to have a good profession and leave a lasting impression on the world in the future. 
		The cornerstones of my life—my family, my education, and my unshakeable resolve—are leading me toward a bright future. 
		My efforts have been motivated by my unwavering commitment, which is like the strong threads holding a tapestry together. 
		It has been the driving force behind my efforts to overcome obstacles, transform failures into learning opportunities, and keep going in the face of difficulty. 
		I've set out on a mission to make my aspirations come true with this resolve.</p>
		<hr>
		
		<h2 align="center" style="color:white">A Journey Unfolding</h2>
		<p align="justify" style="color:#48E9F1; text-indent:30px">My autobiography is far from finished as I write it at the age of 21. 
		Every stage of my life has served as a stepping stone that has brought me one step closer to the person I am intended to be. 
		I welcome the mysteries of the future with open arms, 
		ready to develop and continue my adventure. You will see how these threads gracefully intertwine as you read through the pages of my life, 
		weaving together a rich and colorful tapestry of experiences, development, and transformation. I am eager to keep weaving the tale of my journey, 
		one page at a time, since each chapter and each experience have added to the special and intricate pattern of my life.</p>
